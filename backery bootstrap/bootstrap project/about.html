      <h1 class=" text-muted">MuffinGroup – Who We Are, What We Do, and What We’ve Done</h1>
      <p>We founded MuffinGroup in January of 2012. In October 2014, not quite 3 years later, our team reached a
        significant milestone – the $1million sales mark; qualifying us for membership in the Envato Power Elite
        program. Who are we? How did we accomplish such a remarkable sales feat in so short a time?

        Our team consists of a graphic designer, a coder, a programmer, and a jack-of-all trades support guy. We live
        and work in Poland. We’ve worked together for a number of years, but our turning point came in 2012, when we
        hooked up with ThemeForest.</p>


      <h1 class="text-danger">Our Story</h1>
      <p>Before we formed MuffinGroup, our “gang of four” worked for an interactive agency, which is where we first met.
        Like others having an entrepreneurial spirit, we took stock of ourselves, and decided to strike out on our own,
        as a design and development team.

        We started by creating a WordPress theme called Doover. It was rejected, but we stuck with it, and it was
        eventually approved. With that successful venture under our belts, we took the next step; we quit our full-time
        jobs and started our own company.

        Doover is still up and running. We’ve sold more than 2,000 copies, and it is one of over a dozen WordPress
        themes making up our product line. In fact, Doover has outsold most of our other WordPress themes, but there is
        one very big exception, which leads people to believe that we are a very large company.</p>


      <h1 class="text-success">How We Made Be Theme – A Product Used by 25,000 Web Designers Worldwide</h1>
      <p>Loving the work we do is one thing that led to our creation of Be Theme. The real driver however was
        suggestions and feedback from our customers. It’s always great to know that your customers are happy, but what
        really is great, is when your customers offer their ideas and suggestions as to what they would like to see.

        Different customers, and their clients, have different needs, and they require many different solutions. This
        knowledge led us to create Be Theme, a WordPress theme in which we planned to present demos that would enable
        our customers to choose layouts that met their immediate needs. We also wanted them to be able to do so easily,
        and with just a single click.</p>

      <h1 class="text-secondary">The Next Chapter in Our Story – What We Just Launched</h1>
      <p>BeBuilder has been our premier page builder for quite some time. Like all of the products making up our
        MuffinGroup framework (including Be Theme), we are always looking for ways to improve – thus, the recent launch
        of BeBuilder 3.

        We upgraded our previous version of BeBuilder in a several ways, and we added two impressive new features. We
        improved the overall layouts to make them more readable, by introducing clearer graphics and lighter colors. We
        also improved performance and speed; particularly in the transfer of stored data.

        The new Items Adding feature makes finding the design items you need a much faster process, while the Wraps
        feature provides a more powerful means of creating amazing website content.

        While outlining the improvements to BeBuilder that our customers love and our new customers will as well, we
        don’t want to neglect mentioning Be’s impressive compatibility.</p>
